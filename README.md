# Basic Remote Laser Shutter

<p>
  This is a very basic proof-of-concept for a remote-controlled shutter. I created this out of frustration with the companies that sell a similar product for hundreds to thousands of dollars. While the functionality of this code is limited to a infrared-signal remote, my hope is that some undergraduate or graduate student can take what I have developed and make it better for their own use.
